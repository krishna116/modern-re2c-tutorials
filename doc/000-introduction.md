re2c is a tool used to generate code(C/C++/Go) to extract string features. You can use it to parse string/protocol/data-structure like a regex tool, or you can use it to split tokens from data-buffer like a lexer tool and so on.  

It has many features/apis/switchs/options and it's very powerful, however, it is not easy to learn it. This document try to provide some easy tutorials and conventional usage or design pattern for users/beginners. This document and test code are records of my learning process from a newbie to a user, I also get help/ideas from other people. My native language is not English and I'm not very good at it, so this document and code may be not perfect, so I always ready to listen your thought.

Thanks all the people.
